# House Price Prediction with Regression and Random Forest
 It is my second project practice in machine learning.

Random Forest was found to be the better model for predicting house prices. It out performed the regession algorithms with performance accuracy of 85% using R-squared metric. The most important predictor was the overall quality of a house, following the size of above ground living area and the total basement square footage.

This project is a first pass to get us quickly to a reasonable good model prototype.
